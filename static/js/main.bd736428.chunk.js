However, when faced with several technologies with comparable functionalities, it can be challenging for developers to select the most appropriate one, as trial and error comparisons among such technologies are time-consuming.

However, it is still very opportunistic whether they will get a comprehensive comparison, as online information is often fragmented, contradictory and biased. To overcome these limitations, we propose the DiffTech system that exploits the crowd sourced discussions from Stack Overflow, and assists technology comparison with an informative summary of different comparison aspects.
